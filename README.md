# Small games in Java!
These are some small games that I've created in Java by following guidelines 
from Hyperskill.org.

### Minesweeper
A command-line implementation of Minesweeper. Further extensions could be integration
with Java Swing to make the interface/GUI more presentable.

### Tic-Tac-Toe with AI
This is my currently on going project!
