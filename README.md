# Small projects in Java!
These are some small projects that I've created in Java by following guidelines 
from Hyperskill.org. These have helped develop my skills in Java Programming, and covers a wide spectrum
of topics.

### Minesweeper
A command-line implementation of Minesweeper. It works with I/O where the user input the command to be executed. This could be _'2 2 free'_ or _'5 2 mine'_. Further extensions could be integration with Java Swing to make the interface/GUI more presentable.

##### What have I learned?
- Algorithm development
- Using the I/O in Java

### Tic-Tac-Toe with AI
I have implemented Tic-Tac-Toe with command-line I/O. I have also created three difficulties to play against. 
A command-line implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe. I have also programmed three different AI's to play against.
An __easy__ (Random), __medium__ (Look one move ahead) and __hard__ (Uses Minimax Algorithm).

##### What have I learned?
- The Minimax algorithm (to decide the best possible move)
- How to structure a bigger project.

### Game of Life
