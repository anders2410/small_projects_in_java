# Small projects in Java!
These are some small projects that I've created in Java by following guidelines 
from Hyperskill.org. it varies from games to more complicated implementations, but have all helped develop
me as a programmer.

### Minesweeper
A fully command-line implementation of Minesweeper. Further extensions could be integration
with Java Swing to make the interface/GUI more presentable.

### Tic-Tac-Toe with AI
A command-line implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe. I have also programmed three different AI's to play against.
An __easy__ (Random), __medium__ (Look one move ahead) and __hard__ (Uses Minimax Algorithm).
